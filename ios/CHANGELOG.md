# Changelog
All changes to the software that can be noticed from the users' perspective should have an entry in
this file. Except very minor things that will not affect functionality, such as log message changes
and minor GUI adjustments.

### Format

Entries should have the imperative form, just like commit messages. Start each entry with words like

- Localize some of well known StoreKit errors so that they look less cryptic when presented to user.
- Improve tunnel settings verification to address issues with broken tunnel and missing Keychain

  WireGuard keys)

- Add support for iOS 12.
- Ship the initial relay list with the app, and do once an hour periodic refresh in background.
- Refresh account expiry when visiting settings.

### Fixed

  the relay list before connecting.
- Fix the issue when regenerating the WireGuard key and dismissing the settings at the same
  time could lead to the revoked key still being used by the tunnel, leaving the tunnel unusable.

### Changed
- Remove the WireGuard key from the account inside the VPN tunnel during the log out, if VPN is
  active at that time. Before it would always remove it outside the tunnel.
